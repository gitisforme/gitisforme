👋 Hello, I'm Andrey, a senior software developer with over 10 years of experience in creating innovative software solutions.

🚀 My passion for coding and creating elegant solutions has driven me to work on a wide range of projects, from developing web applications and APIs to creating automation scripts and tools.

👨‍💻 I'm experienced in multiple programming languages including Python, Java, and JavaScript, and have worked with frameworks such as Django, Flask, React, and Node.js.

💡 My philosophy is that coding is both an art and a science, and I strive to create solutions that are not only functional and efficient, but also elegant and easy to understand.

🌟 Some of my recent projects include:

A web-based project management tool built with React and Node.js
A Python-based automation tool for data processing and analysis
An e-commerce platform built with Django and React
🔭 When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies and experimenting with new programming languages.
